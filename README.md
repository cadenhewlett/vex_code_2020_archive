## Final Vex Code (archive)

Welcome to my VEX Robotics code archive! This is where you'll find the code for my old high school VEX Robotics project.

The Zip File contains the arhive of the entire repository. 

### `autonomous.cpp`
This is where the magic happens for the autonomous phase. It has all the routines the robot runs on its own during the competition.

### `config.cpp`
This file sets up all the robot's hardware-motors, sensors, controllers, you name it. It gets everything ready to go.

### `opcontrol.cpp`
Handles the driver control phase. It takes inputs from the controller and tells the robot what to do based on those inputs.

### `robot-config.cpp`
This file is all about defining the robot's devices and sensors. It's usually generated by VEXcode V5 and includes all the hardware definitions.

### `vex.h`
This file includes all the essential VEX libraries and defines some constants and macros used in our code. It's like the ultimate toolkit for VEX functions and definitions.
